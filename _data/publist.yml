  description: International investments in the port development become popular including the cases of Chinese companies who are continuously signing concession contracts with many other countries to promote the Belt and Road Initiative. One important issue in a concession contract between an investor and a container terminal operator is how the rental fee is calculated. This study discusses how the port investor optimises the parameters of fixed and variable rental fees for both the cases with a deterministic and an uncertain cargo demand. This study analyzes cases with an uncertain cargo demand in which terminal operators and the port investor may have the same or different degrees of uncertainty on cargo demand. The uncertainty in the cargo demand was found to decrease the revenue of the port investor and increase the profits of the terminal operators..

- title: "A game theoretic model and a coevolutionary solution procedure to determine the terminal handling charges for container terminals"
  image: PUB_CIEjournal.jpg
  description: A game theoretic model was proposed for multiple container terminals competing with each other to maximize their own profits by determining their terminal handling charges (THCs) that affect the market shares of terminals. The pricing model can describe both the competitive and cooperative games. The congestion cost of the terminals was also considered in the cost term, and revenue sharing rental fee schemes with two-step unit fees were analyzed. To overcome the difficulty in obtaining the Nash Equilibrium of the THCs for container terminals, this study proposed a coevolution-based procedure that adopts the neighborhood structure on toroidal grids and supports localized interactions among species. The numerical experiments showed that both the cost model with the congestion cost and the revenue sharing scheme help improve the total profit of the port. In addition, the results obtained by the coevolution-based procedure in this study were compared with those in previous studies..
