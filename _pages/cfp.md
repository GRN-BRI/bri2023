# call for paper

**Theme:** The Greening, Reliability and Security of Global Maritime Transportation and Logistics

Automation has become an indispensable characteristic inherent in ports, which are key nodes of the global logistics network. In recent years, with the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, smart port and shipping are attracting more and more attention from both researchers and practitioners. The applied AI technologies will not only improve the performance of existing maritime logistics network, but also upgrade the potential of new generation maritime system. In addition, the maritime systems may explore new opportunities and challenges of a more comprehensive and tailored cooperation with smart supply chains.
